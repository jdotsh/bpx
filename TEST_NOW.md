### **📍 WHAT'S WORKING:**

1. ✅ **Server is running** on port 3000
2. ✅ **Pages are loading** (Homepage, Studio, Auth)
3. ✅ **API is responding** (health check shows "unhealthy" for database but that's OK for testing)
4. ✅ **Mock authentication** is set up (you can create accounts without Supabase)

## **📊 API STATUS CHECK:**

```bash
# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Response shows:
# - status: "unhealthy" (due to no database - OK for testing)

# - version: "2.0.0"
```

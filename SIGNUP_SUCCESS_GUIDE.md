- ✅ Triggers installed
- ✅ RLS policies active

## 🧪 TEST SIGNUP NOW!

### Method 1: Use the Web UI (Recommended)

1. **Open signup page:**
   http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

2. **Enter your details:**
   - Name: Julian Sherollari
   - Email: jdotsh@gmail.com (or any real email)
   - Password: (6+ characters)

3. **Click "Create account"**

4. **Check your email:**
   - Look for email from Supabase
   - Check spam folder
   - May take 1-2 minutes

5. **Click verification link**

6. **Sign in:**
   http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

## 📊 Current System Status:

```
✅ Database: Connected & Tables Created
✅ Auth: Supabase Auth Ready
✅ Service Role: Configured
✅ Email: Will send (3-4/hour limit)
```

## 🔍 Verify in Supabase Dashboard:

### Check Your Tables:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/adjdqxptoaecafmmjgtf/editor
2. You should see:
   - `profiles` table
   - `projects` table
   - `subscriptions` table

### After Signup, Check Users:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/adjdqxptoaecafmmjgtf/auth/users
2. Your new user should appear here

### Check Profile Creation:
1. Go to Table Editor → `profiles`
2. After signup, user profile should auto-create

## ⚠️ Note About API Error:

The "Invalid API key" error in API calls might occur because:
1. RLS policies are strict (this is good for security!)
2. Service role key might need different permissions
